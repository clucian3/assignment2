        <h2>(specifically) Saquon Barkley</h2>

        <p>Barkley gave Kamil Bautista, 11, tickets to a game between the Giants and the New York Jets later in the season after the boy was <strong>denied</strong> an autograph. The snub happened after the Giants <strong> lost </strong> to the Cowboys during the first week of the season. </p>

            <p>Here are some stats that <sub>Saquon</sub> has accomplished, from the weeks.</p>

            <ul>
                <li> @Cowboys: YDS: 120 AVG: 10.9 </li>
                <li> Bills YDS: YDS: 107 AVG: 5.9 </li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li> 2018 Season Yards: 1307</li>
                <li> 2019 Season Yards: 227</li>
            </ol>
